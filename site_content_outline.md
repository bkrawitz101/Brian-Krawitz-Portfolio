## 4. Bio Section

**Paragraph 1:**
> Brian Krawitz is a multidimensional artist working at the intersection of light, sacred geometry, and immersive technology. For over 15 years, he has been translating the invisible frequencies of consciousness into tangible, inhabitable forms—both physical and virtual.

**Paragraph 2:**
> His journey began in the New York City underground electronic music scene of the early 90s, where he discovered that light and sound could function as catalysts for transformation rather than mere decoration. This revelation led him to develop a unique practice: creating large-scale temples and light sculptures specifically designed to be inhabited—spaces that serve as containers for community coherence and personal resonance.

**Paragraph 3:**
> In the physical realm, Brian has designed and fabricated award-winning installations for Burning Man, including his role as Project Lead for the Temple of Flux (2010)—one of the largest temple structures in the event's history—and Lighting Design Lead for major collaborative works like Zoa (2012) and Mens Amplio (2013). His solo pieces, from the Flower of Life-inspired "Life Within Itself" to the interactive "Fountain of Pon Lai" exhibited at the San Francisco Exploratorium, demonstrate his mastery of brass fabrication, LED engineering, and sacred geometric principles.

**Paragraph 4:**
> As the digital frontier opened, Brian pioneered the translation of his physical light work into virtual reality. He creates immersive VR sanctuaries and educational environments on platforms like AltspaceVR and Spatial.io, including Unity Sanctuary—a meditative yurt-inspired space—and TESOL VR Worlds, which leverages spatial memory for language acquisition. His work with Singularity University on projects like "Wise Mirror" explores narrative-driven VR experiences that bridge storytelling, community, and consciousness.

**Paragraph 5:**
> Whether working with steel and frosted acrylic or Unity and 3D modeling software, Brian's work maintains a singular focus: to create portals between the seen and unseen, the physical and the energetic, the individual and the collective. His installations and environments are not simply observed—they are entered, experienced, and remembered as moments of transformation.

**Paragraph 6:**
> Currently based in Nevada County, California, Brian continues to develop both physical and virtual works that invite participants to step out of the ordinary and into the extraordinary.
